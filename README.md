# Title:
Blogger Tech

# Description:
This challenge asked us to make a tech blog where people can post blogs along with allowing clients to add comments. This challenge helped us combine all the skills we had learned on the backend side. 

# Assignment Tasks:
1. When the user visits the site they are presented with a website that shows them exisitng blog posts, a navigation bar on the dashboard and a login page
2. The homepage link takes the user to the homepage when clicked on
3. Clicking on any links means that the user is either taken to the sign up page or the sign out page
4. When the person signs up then they are prompted to fill out a username and password
5. When a user clicks signup there credentials are saved and they are taken to the login page
6. When a user revisits the site they are given the choice to reenter their username and password
7. When a user is signed in to the site they can see the logout button the link to the dashboard and the homepage
8. Basically the other tasks were to have a user be able to create a new blog post and use routes to update or get rid of a post
9. The last few tasks were having the user sign in again if they were ever idle

# Future Development:
We have projects in this cohort due tomorrow so I ran out of time to get this one done since it is also do tomorrow and the project takes priority
After the cohort is over I will revisit this and work on getting the code built up as much as I can to reflect what I have learned in the cohort so far.
