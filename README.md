# Title:
Blogger Tech

# Application Description:
This application solves the problem of a developer not being able to reach out to other developers in other states or interacting with other developers they have not met in person. The application solves this problem by being a blog where developers of all skill levels can post articles on new coding concepts and procedures that are constantly added to the world of web developement. Developers are able to communicate with each other on this application through the ability to leave comments on articles that have already been posted and say wherther or not the article they read was useful or not.

# Application Organization:
This challenge had us do everything from scratch so I coded the frontend and backend from the ground up. I organized the background as restful api enviroment with a db folder for the database, connection folder to connect the server to the database, models folder for all of the tables, controllers folder for the routes, seeds folder for the actual data, and a public folder for all of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. The User model was used 

# Assignment Tasks:
1. When the user visits the site they are presented with a website that shows them exisitng blog posts, a navigation bar on the dashboard and a login page
2. The homepage link takes the user to the homepage when clicked on
3. Clicking on any links means that the user is either taken to the sign up page or the sign out page
4. When the person signs up then they are prompted to fill out a username and password
5. When a user clicks signup there credentials are saved and they are taken to the login page
6. When a user revisits the site they are given the choice to reenter their username and password
7. When a user is signed in to the site they can see the logout button the link to the dashboard and the homepage
8. Basically the other tasks were to have a user be able to create a new blog post and use routes to update or get rid of a post
9. The last few tasks were having the user sign in again if they were ever idle

# Assingment Tasks Achieved By:
These tasks were achieved by looking at module 14 and revewing the lesson material. It helped as a guide when I had to create posts and had to update an existing post. Time management helps a lot with this assignment as well.
